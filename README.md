# ship-it-out-client v3

shipItOut-client practice with TypeScript, Cypress, react-router-dom v6, MUI v5, Formik, Yup, ESLint, Prettier, or at least that's the plan, maybe include mongodb.

Maybe i'll add atom, graphql, ect as well.

I had issues running project with `yarn`, so sticking with `npm` for now.

Project V2 can be found here, [frontend](https://github.com/CheoR/shipItOut-client) and [backend](https://github.com/CheoR/shipItOut-server).
